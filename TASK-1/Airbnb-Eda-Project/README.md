# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb Listings

## Project Description
In this project, we performed basic data analysis on a dataset of Airbnb listings. EDA is a fundamental step in data science that involves exploring and understanding the data before diving into more complex analysis or modeling.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is the "Seattle Airbnb Open Data" from Kaggle

## Steps Implemented
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.
2. **Data Exploration**: Loaded and examined the dataset to understand its structure.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data inconsistencies.
4. **Basic Statistics**: Calculated and visualized the average price of listings, the distribution of property types, and the distribution of listings by neighborhood.
5. **Visualization**: Created visualizations to explore relationships and trends in the data.
6. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated correlations between different features using a correlation matrix.
7. **Geospatial Analysis (Optional)**: Created maps to visualize the distribution of Airbnb listings across different neighborhoods.
8. **Time Series Analysis (Optional)**: Analyzed how the number of listings or prices change over time.
9. **Data Insights**: Summarized findings and provided insights from the analysis.

## Data Insights
- The average price of listings is approximately $127.98.
- The most common property types are apartments and houses.
- Some neighborhoods have significantly more listings than others.
- There are weak correlations between most features, indicating diverse influences on listing characteristics.
- Higher availability might be associated with more frequent reviews.

This completes the exploratory data analysis on the Airbnb listings dataset.
