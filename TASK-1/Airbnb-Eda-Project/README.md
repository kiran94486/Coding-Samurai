#DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP (TASK 1) 
#Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb Listings 
##Project Description: In this project, you will perform basic data analysis on a dataset of 
Airbnb listings. EDA is a fundamental step in data science that involves exploring and 
understanding the data before diving into more complex analysis or modeling.
Steps you can Implement: 
Data Collection: Find a dataset of Airbnb listings in a city of your choice. You can often 
find such datasets on websites like Kaggle, Inside Airbnb, or by using Airbnb's official 
API (if available).
Data Exploration: Load and examine the dataset to get a sense of its structure. Look at 
the first few rows, data types, and basic statistics.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and clean the data. This may involve filling 
missing values, removing duplicates, or correcting data inconsistencies.

Basic Statistics: Calculate and visualize basic statistics like the average price of listings, 
the distribution of property types (e.g., apartments, houses, etc.), and the distribution of 
neighborhoods.
Visualization: Create visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to explore 
relationships and trends in the data. For example, you can plot price distributions, room 
type preferences, or the number of listings by neighborhood.
Geospatial Analysis (Optional): If your dataset includes geographic information, you 
can perform simple geospatial analysis. Create maps to visualize the distribution of 
Airbnb listings across different neighborhoods or areas.
Time Series Analysis (Optional): If your dataset includes a date field, you can analyze 
how the number of listings or prices change over time. You can create time series plots 
and explore seasonality trends.
Correlation Analysis: Investigate correlations between different features. For instance, 
you can check if the number of bedrooms is correlated with the price or if the reviews 
affect the booking rates.
Data Insights: Summarize your findings and provide insights from your analysis. What 
interesting patterns or trends did you discover? What neighborhoods seem to be the 
most popular, and what factors might influence listing prices?
Documentation: Document your project, including the data source, steps you took, and 
the insights you gained. This documentation will be useful for presenting your findings 
and referring back to your work.
